# Fizz Buzz

This repository contains the source code of a videogame that integrates the [FizzBuzz problem](http://wiki.c2.com/?FizzBuzzTest)'s logic into its gameplay mechanics. You can play it in-browser [here](https://miguelcok27.itch.io/fizzbuzz). It was developed with [Unity](https://unity.com), version 2021.3.

The [Wiki](https://github.com/mnicolas94/ce-fizz-buzz/wiki) covers all the information about the project.
